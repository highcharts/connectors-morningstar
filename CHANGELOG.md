### Upgrade notes

1. Security Details (SD): Adjusted `SecurityDetails` & `SecurityCompare` connectors' column names to match the naming convention.
Previously, connectors could return only one data type. This has now been updated to support multiple data tables per connector, reducing number of requests and improving flexibility. Key changes include:

    - Added support for multiple converter types available in one connector: `converters: ['AssetAllocations', 'RegionalExposure']`. Setting converter.type is still available for backwards compatibility.
    - Each returned converter type is now accessible via a key in the `dataTables`, so in order to access data use `connector.dataTables['AssetAllocations']` or `connector.dataTables.AssetAllocations`, instead of the `connector.table`
    - Full list of renamed column names for converters: https://github.com/highcharts/connectors-morningstar/pull/109

2. Portfolio Analysis XRay (EMEA/APAC): Adjusted `XRay` column names to match the naming convention.
Previously, all of the returned data points were stored in one table. This has now been updated to support multiple data tables per connector, reducing number of requests and improving flexibility. Key changes include:

    - Added splitting returned data points from connectors to multiple data tables.
    - Added missing properties like `Type/ReturnType/Date/...`  to column names.
    - Added `_Benchmark` suffix for all columns generated from benchmark data point type.
    - Each returned data point is now accessible via a key in the `dataTables`, so in order to access data use `connector.dataTables['StyleBox']` or `connector.dataTables.StyleBox`, instead of the `connector.table`
    - Removed connector and converter name from column name.

Column name `XRay_TotalReturn_TimePeriod` is now changed to `XRay_TotalReturn_M1` and `XRay_TotalReturn_Value` is changed to `XRay_TotalReturn_M1_Value`. Where `M1` is used, it will be automatically changed to returned periods like `M1/M2/M3/M6` etc.
